## Another Day

It's another day and I'm here hoping that you find this post. It's a rant that I have about this country. I'm really disappointed at the amount of ignorant people that live in this country.

It's a shame to be a part of such a nation that so powerful yet the inhabitants are so domb.

We had our Presidential elections on Nov.5 and the country elected a total idiot wanna be dictator. I just can't believe the amount of idiodocy that runs rampant in our country.
